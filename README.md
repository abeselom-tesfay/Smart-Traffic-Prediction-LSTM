Traffic Flow Prediction Using LSTM
Introduction
Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) plays a vital role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) by helping predict traffic patterns and optimize traffic management [1]. As cities around the world continue to urbanize, they face growing challenges such as traffic congestion, delays, and environmental pollution.

In response, many countries have adopted ITS to address these issues, reducing the economic burden caused by congestion. ITS integrates advanced technologies like data communication, information processing, and predictive analytics to improve transportation efficiency and safety [2]. TFP is a fundamental component of ITS, supporting functions such as speed regulation, travel time estimation, and congestion management.

Recent advancements in smart city initiatives have increased the availability of traffic data, enabling the development of data-driven predictive models. These models enhance transportation networks by reducing travel time, boosting productivity, and minimizing the environmental impact of traffic. Among various approaches, deep learning (DL) methods—particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—have gained prominence for their ability to process sequential data and outperform traditional machine learning (ML) techniques in accuracy and efficiency [3].

Unlike traditional ML models, which often demand extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, DL methods such as LSTMs streamline these steps and excel at identifying patterns from large datasets. This capability makes DL particularly suitable for TFP, especially as real-time traffic data becomes more abundant.

This report focuses on applying LSTM networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to model sequential data and capture long-term dependencies, to predict traffic flow. Specifically, the report aims to forecast traffic volumes between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, by predicting traffic conditions two hours into the future using a six-hour window of historical data.

Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a global issue, leading to longer travel times, increased air pollution, economic losses, and safety risks [4-6]. Traditional solutions, such as expanding road infrastructure, are often insufficient to address the growing complexity of traffic demands. Furthermore, conventional navigation systems, while helpful for real-time guidance, often fail to accurately predict future traffic conditions, especially in areas with sparse data or unreliable connectivity.

To effectively reduce congestion, modern solutions require advanced predictive models that integrate historical and real-time traffic data. LSTM networks, in particular, have proven effective in modeling sequential traffic patterns and capturing temporal dependencies in traffic data.

This study aims to develop an LSTM-based predictive model that uses historical traffic data to forecast traffic flow two hours ahead. By offering accurate and scalable predictions, the proposed model serves as a proactive solution to enhance traffic management and reduce congestion.

Data Types, Sources, and Parameters for Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP)
Accurate traffic flow prediction requires data from various sources and parameters, including:

Mapping Data
A detailed road network map with associated attributes is essential. Integrating with global map data providers like Google Maps, TomTom, HERE, or OSM ensures access to comprehensive and up-to-date information.

Traffic Information
Both historical and real-time traffic data, such as vehicle count, speed, and type (e.g., trucks, light vehicles), are necessary. This data can be collected using devices like loop detectors, cameras, weighbridges, and radars. Alternatively, providers like Otonomo leverage Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology to collect data from connected vehicles.

Weather Information
Weather data, including historical, current, and forecasted conditions, is crucial, as meteorological factors significantly affect traffic flow. Reliable weather data can be obtained from sources like OpenWeather and Tomorrow.io.

Additional Road Condition Data
External sources, such as social media posts, local news, and police scanners, provide valuable information that impacts traffic conditions.

Multi-Parameter Prediction Approach
TFP models use a multi-parameter approach, considering various traffic patterns:

Flow: The number of vehicles passing through a point in a specific time.

Speed: Distance traveled per unit of time.

Day: Days of the week (Sunday to Saturday).

Day Type: Categories like holidays, weekends, or weekdays.

Clock Time: Hourly divisions (1-24 hours).

Weather Conditions: Factors like sunny or rainy weather for training and forecasting.

Traffic Theory
Key variables for TFP include traffic flow (q) and density (k):

Traffic flow (q): The number of vehicles passing a reference point per unit of time.

Traffic density (k): The number of vehicles per unit length of road. Critical density is the point beyond which traffic flow decreases and congestion occurs.

Free flow: When traffic density is below the critical level, traffic operates in free flow, and the relationship between flow and speed is given by "flow = speed × density."

Literature Review
The literature on TFP and ITS examines various techniques and data sources for traffic forecasting. TFP primarily focuses on predicting short-term congestion using historical data, with many studies incorporating real-time data to improve accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, especially deep learning (DL) models like LSTM, have shown great promise in enhancing TFP performance.

Recent studies also explore the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for traffic forecasting. For example, Google Maps integrates both real-time and historical traffic data to reliably predict future traffic conditions.
