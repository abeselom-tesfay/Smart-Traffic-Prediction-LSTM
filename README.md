# 🚦 Smart Traffic Flow Prediction using LSTM

This project applies a deep learning model (LSTM – Long Short-Term Memory) to predict traffic flow between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. It forecasts traffic volumes two hours ahead based on the previous six hours of data.

## 📌 Why It Matters

Traffic congestion causes delays, pollution, and economic loss. While traditional systems react to traffic, LSTM models help cities **predict and manage traffic proactively**, improving flow and safety.

## 📊 What the Model Does

- Uses historical traffic data like vehicle count, speed, time, and weather
- Learns traffic patterns over time
- Predicts traffic volume 2 hours into the future

## 🧠 Why LSTM?

LSTM networks are ideal for time-based data. They remember long-term trends and patterns, making them highly effective for forecasting traffic flow.

## 📁 Data Sources

- Cleaned traffic volume dataset  
- Time-based features: hour, day of the week, holidays  
- Weather data: rainfall, temperature, etc.
